# Middleman

This is a generic Middleman engine used to launch [Nanobox](http://nanobox.io) that identifies a ruby project by the presence of a Gemfile in the root of the project. The engine will create a web if it finds a config.ru file. By default it will use [rackup](http://rack.github.io/) to start the a web server. [Thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/), [puma](http://puma.io/), and [unicorn](http://unicorn.bogomips.org/) are also available.

## App Detection
To detect a Middleman app, this engine checks for the presence of a Gemfile.

## Build Process
- `bundle install`
- `bundle clean`

## Important Things to Know
- The engine will only create a default web service if there is a `config.ru` or an `app.rb` in the root of the application.
- If a `config.ru` file exists, the engine will launch the app as a rack app (`webserver: rackup`), unless a different [webserver](#webserver) is specified.

## Basic Configuration Options

This engine exposes configuration options through the [Boxfile](http://docs.nanobox.io/boxfile/), a yaml config file used to provision and configure your app's infrastructure when using Nanobox. 

##### *Advanced Configuration Options*
This Readme outlines only the most basic and commonly used settings. For the full list of available configuration options, view the **[Advanced Middleman Configuration options](https://github.com/nanobox-io/nanobox-engine-ruby/blob/master/doc/advanced-ruby-config.md)**.

#### Overview of Basic Boxfile Configuration Options
```yaml
build:
